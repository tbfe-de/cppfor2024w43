Instead of showing the time collect them in a `ostringstream output`
(header file is "sstream") as 3rd argument oo `run:loop`,

When done the result ist available os output.str() and can be
processed from there as a long string. Retrieve from there
and collect in a std::vector<float> using an std::istream_iterator.
Convert to differences between elements,
sort, shwoe the maximum, the minmum, and the average.

optional: if you want shor also as a simple bar graph
